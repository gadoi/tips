Scan sub directory
ffuf -u http://api-prod.horizontall.htb/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
gobuster dir -u http://api-prod.horizontall.htb/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

scan subdomain vs dns

gobuster dns -d horizontall.htb -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt

Scan vhost
gobuster vhost -u horizontall.htb -w subdomains-top1million-110000.txt --threads 50

ffuf -w subdomains.txt -u http://horizontall.htb -H “Host: FUZZ.horizontal.htb”
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://horizontall.htb -H "Host: FUZZ" -fs 4242

Directory and File Discovery
The directories on the website can be discovered with the following command which gives ffuf a word-list with -w flag and URL with -u command which contains the word FUZZ, that signifies the position to be fuzzed.
    ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://website.com/FUZZ

For file discovery, the same command can be used and for using specific extensions with the word-list’s entries, the -e flag can be used.

    ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://website.com/FUZZ -e .aspx,.html,.php,.txt
    
eg: ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://jokerctf.thm/FUZZ -e .aspx,.html,.php,.txt -mc 200,302


For getting output of responses with status code 200 and 302 only, use:

    ffuf -w wordlist.txt -w http://website.com/FUZZ -e .aspx,.html -mc 200,302
